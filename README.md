## Code validation 

### Testing

Testing documentation, including User Stories, can be found here: [Testing](assets/docs/Testing.md) 

#### Solved bugs

1. Navbar was disappearing on page load: The issue has been solved by setting display: 'block' on page load, for desktop browsers, and by setting fixed-top navbar for mobile browsers (as the navbar was oversensitive to window scroll, causing additional issues.)
2. When selecting a location from the respective menu, the popup for the location's marker was overflowing out of the map (in smaller screen sizes): The issue has been solves by centring the popup in the middle of the map, rather than the marker.
3. When pressing the DAY or NIGHT button in the 'Location section', the map gets populated with all the markers connected to the relevant locations (all collected into a layer). However, I could not connect each specific marker to the respective button from the "locations' list": The issue has been solved by setting the map so that when pressing a specific location button, the map would clear from all the markers present and would generate a single new marker for the desired location.

#### Unsolved bugs

1. Sometimes, the home slideshow becomes shows the white background instead of displaying the next picture.
2. When clicking on a location button for the first time, the map does not center the marker's popup. This causes the popup to partly overflow out of the map in small screen sizes. However, the problem does not reoccur after the first click. 
3. On certain mobile browsers (i.e. Safari), it is sometimes necessary to hold pressed on a marker (on the map) in order to open the popup attached, instead of just tapping on it.
